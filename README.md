# Custom-pixel-art-implosion
### Custom pixel art animation(implosion) using GSAP bounce

This demo uses the pixel art to build 0/1 matrix centered according to the current wrapper.
The active pixels have their movement vectors calculated using some basic trigonometry and scaled
to wrapper's aspect ratio.

Currently application showcases implosion effect, though changing it to explosion is rather easy.
